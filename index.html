<h2>Jason Williams</h2> <img src="jwill.jpg" width="150">
<p>Personal life
    Despite his NBA success, Williams preferred to stay out of the spotlight and live a low-key lifestyle, spending time with his family. Williams married Denika Kisty, a University of Florida alumna, a former member of the Florida Gators track and field team, and an All-American javelin thrower.[42] Williams and his wife have three children; in his NBA profile, he listed his family as his "most treasured possession".[3]
    
    Williams is a close friend of former Miami Heat teammate and center Shaquille O'Neal, having been neighbors in Orlando for three years. "I was the one who helped broker the deal this summer", O'Neal said (in 2005) of the five-team, 13-player trade that brought Williams to Miami. "He wanted to play with me and I wanted to play with a guard who loves to pass and I think it'll be a good combination for myself and [guard] Dwyane Wade."[43]
    
    Williams has a number of tattoos, which include a panther on his right arm, a dragon on his left arm (which was redone in the 2007–08 season), an eye on his chest of which he said, "It's why I pass so good, I have a 3rd eye". In the 2000–01 season, he had a wolf holding a basketball tattooed on his arm, and "WHITEBOY"[44] tattooed across his knuckles. He also has his children's names on his forearms.[citation needed]
